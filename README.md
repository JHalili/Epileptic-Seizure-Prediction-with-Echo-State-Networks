# Epileptic-Seizure-Prediction-with-Echo-State-Networks
* The EEG signals used for this project can be found in the following [CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database](https://physionet.org/pn6/chbmit/)
#Experiments run
* Due to the time that computations for such task require the first expreiments involved running the echo 
* state network only on the first patient.
